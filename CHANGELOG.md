# Changelog

All notable public changes are documented here. Internal QA/profile artifacts
are not releases.

## 1.2.7 (914)

- Added the Bots workspace with profiles, rooms, mentions and task-focused
  collaboration adapted from Hermes Desktop contracts.
- Added native companion rendering and configurable Blobatar bot identities.
- Added structured generated-image and artifact viewing without changing the
  approved textual chat streaming path.
- Improved Android back navigation between regular conversations and Bots.
- Redesigned voice and dictation settings so the active on-device/server route
  is explicit.
- Aligned Voice with the Hermes Desktop streaming contract, including
  `speak-stream`, single-response fallback, interruption acknowledgement and
  cleanup behavior.
- Improved typography, floating menus and transient notifications across small
  Android screens.
- Raised the Android target SDK to 36 and addressed current Play requirements.
- Prepared the project for publication under GPL-3.0-only with a fresh public
  history and preserved upstream notices.

Final signed artifacts are published only after physical-device QA and the
release gate in [the distribution guide](docs/RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION.md).

## 1.2.6 (913)

- Previous Google Play baseline.

Earlier development history predates the fresh public repository. GitHub
Releases remain the authoritative source for future public release notes and
artifact checksums.
